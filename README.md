# stroke_patient_analysis
This is my third and final capstone for Thinkful. This project was the most open-ended, as I was able to choose my own dataset of interest to explore and analyze using Python.

Project Deliverables:
1. A project proposal outlining my dataset, hypothesis, and purpose for the analysis.
2. A Jupyter Notebook that tells a compelling story about my data.
3. A PowerPoint deck presenting my results.
4. A live presentation where I share my findings and recommendations.

Demonstrated Tools & Techniques: 
- Python - Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib 
- PowerPoint
