# stroke_patient_analysis
This is my third and final capstone for Thinkful. This project was the most open-ended, as I was able to choose my own dataset of interest to explore and analyze using Python.

Deliverables:
1. A one-page project proposal
2. A Jupyter Notebook that tells a compelling story about my data
3. A live PowerPoint presentation of my findings
